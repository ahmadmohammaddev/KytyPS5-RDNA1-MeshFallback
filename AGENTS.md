# Instructions for Codex — KytyPS5 RDNA1 Mesh Fallback

This project is experimental C++/Vulkan emulator research, **not** a finished patch. The source of truth across sessions is `docs/RDNA1_MESH_FALLBACK_PLAN.md`.

## Before every task
1. Read the ENTIRE `docs/RDNA1_MESH_FALLBACK_PLAN.md` and root `README.md` (plus relevant upstream docs).
2. Run `git status`, `git log -1 --oneline`, `git branch --show-current`, and inspect submodule state.
3. Summarize what is verified vs merely planned. Select **only one** subtask of the active phase.
4. Verify exact file names, APIs, code paths and build flags in the checked-out tree; never guess.

## Development rules
- Preserve GPL license, third-party notices, and upstream credit.
- Pinned starting tag: `u59-windows-20261024-int21` (`744705e` short); work on `feature/rdna1-mesh-fallback`. No silent upstream merges/rebases.
- No game assets, firmware, keys, dumps, compiled proprietary shaders or user-specific paths in git. No DRM circumvention work.
- Use isolated and opt-in fallback code; never spoof a missing Vulkan feature or silently skip required geometry.
- Favor small testable patches; keep working native mesh rendering unchanged by default.
- A passing compile, splash screen, and GPU-rendered gameplay are three **different** milestones.
- Build and run automated tests where possible; state what was *not* run. Use validation tooling for SPIR-V, Vulkan and synchronization.
- Do not assume Mesa Lavapipe results imply native RX 5700 XT success.

## Plan is intentionally editable
You MAY reprioritize, split, merge, or remove future milestones based on evidence. If so, update the live plan and append a reason to Decision Register and Change History. Never rewrite experiment/session history to hide failures or declare an unverified milestone completed.

## At end of EVERY session, mandatory
1. Update live plan checkpoint, evidence, phase status, experiment/decision log when relevant, and append a detailed session handoff entry.
2. Give the exact next single task with a testable acceptance gate.
3. Commit the .md updates alongside related code, or explicitly document why a commit was impossible.
4. In your response state branch, SHA, files changed, commands/tests + actual results, blockers, and next step.
5. **Stop** after the selected subtask; do not start the next phase automatically.

## Immediate first task
P0.1/P0.2 only: verify fork, recursive clone, pinned release tag, branch, remotes, submodules, and plan files. DO NOT start implementing Mesh Shaders yet. If user has not cloned/forked, give precise missing command(s) and stop.
